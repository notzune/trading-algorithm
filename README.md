# trading-algorithim

Stock trading algorithim built using [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert).

## Project Goal

The goal is to create a stock market trading algorithm that scrubs news articles and social media posts for a particular
stock/ticker and uses [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) to calculate the sentiment of the stock based
on the that specific piece of media. Then compiles the sentiments into a dataset then makes a decision on whether to buy
or sell.
